# What Was Changed - Migration Summary

## Overview

Your project has been completely restructured from a Next.js application to a full-stack assignment project with separate backend and frontend folders.

## New Structure

```
Before (Next.js):
Ass/
├── src/
├── public/
├── next.config.ts
└── package.json

After (Full-Stack):
Ass/
├── backend/
│   ├── Assignment1/    (.NET 8 - Basic Task Manager)
│   └── Assignment2/    (.NET 8 - Project Manager + Smart Scheduler)
├── frontend/           (React + TypeScript - Vite)
└── Documentation files
```

## What Was Added

### Backend Folder

**Assignment 1** - Basic Task Manager (Port 5001)
- Complete .NET 8 Web API
- In-memory task storage
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Swagger documentation
- CORS configuration

**Assignment 2** - Mini Project Manager + Smart Scheduler (Port 5002)
- Complete .NET 8 Web API
- Entity Framework Core with In-Memory database
- JWT authentication system
- User management
- Project and Task management
- Smart Scheduler with topological sort algorithm
- Swagger documentation
- CORS configuration

### Frontend Folder

**New React Application** (Port 3000)
- Built with Vite (not Next.js)
- TypeScript support
- React Router for navigation
- Authentication context
- Components:
  - Navbar with assignment links
  - Home page
  - Assignment 1 page (Task Manager UI)
  - Assignment 2 pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, Project Detail)
- Axios for API calls
- Custom CSS styling (no framework)

### Documentation Files

1. **README.md** - Main project documentation
2. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed setup instructions
3. **ASSIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md** - Complete feature list
4. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick commands and tips
5. **backend/Assignment1/README.md** - Assignment 1 docs
6. **backend/Assignment2/README.md** - Assignment 2 & 3 docs
7. **frontend/README.md** - Frontend documentation

## What Was Kept

The original Next.js files remain in the root directory:
- src/ folder
- public/ folder
- next.config.ts
- package.json
- etc.

**Note:** These old files are not used in the new structure. You can safely delete them or keep them as backup.

## Technologies Changed

### Before
- Next.js 15
- React Server Components
- Next.js API Routes
- Vercel deployment focus

### After
- Backend: C# .NET 8 Web API
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite
- Separate API servers
- Full-stack architecture

## Key Differences

### Routing
- **Before:** Next.js App Router (`app/` directory)
- **After:** React Router DOM in frontend

### API
- **Before:** Next.js API routes in `src/app/api/`
- **After:** Separate .NET Web APIs in `backend/`

### Styling
- **Before:** Tailwind CSS (from globals.css)
- **After:** Custom CSS files per component

### Database
- **Before:** Not clearly defined
- **After:** In-memory databases (both assignments)

### Authentication
- **Before:** Auth0 setup
- **After:** Custom JWT implementation in Assignment 2

## How to Use the New Structure

1. **Ignore the old Next.js files** - They're not needed
2. **Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step instructions
3. **Run 3 servers simultaneously:**
   - Assignment 1 backend (port 5001)
   - Assignment 2 backend (port 5002)
   - Frontend (port 3000)

## Migration Checklist

If you want to clean up the old files:

- [ ] Keep: `backend/`, `frontend/`, all `.md` files
- [ ] Optional Delete: `src/`, `public/`, Next.js config files
- [ ] Optional Delete: Old `package.json` (frontend has its own)
- [ ] Keep: `.gitignore`

## Benefits of New Structure

✅ Clear separation of concerns (backend/frontend)
✅ Multiple backend services (microservices approach)
✅ Technology diversity (C# + React)
✅ Better for learning full-stack development
✅ Matches assignment requirements exactly
✅ Easy to deploy separately
✅ Swagger documentation for APIs
✅ Professional project structure

## Next Steps

1. Read SETUP_GUIDE.md
2. Install prerequisites (.NET 8, Node.js)
3. Run all three servers
4. Test each assignment
5. Review the code
6. Deploy if needed

**Bottom Line:** Your project is now a complete full-stack application with all three assignments implemented, ready to run and test!
